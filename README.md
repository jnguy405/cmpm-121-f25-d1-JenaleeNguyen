# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Step 1: Created a button using TypeScript and input a 'fun' emoji. The ricebowl serves as the basis for a rice farming and chef simulator.
Step 2: Implemented a counter to track the total number of ricebowls accumulated per click.
Step 3: Set automatic clicker to add 1 unit per second in addition to player input.
Step 4: Utilzed RequestAnimationFrame callback to calculate frame rates + performance, continuous growth, and update counter.
Step 5: Instantiated counter growth to zero until upgrades are purchased and the RPS increases. Added upgrade button to exchange ricebowls for RPS.
