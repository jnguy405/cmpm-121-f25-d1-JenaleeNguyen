# CMPM 121 D1 Project

## Development Steps

1. **Step 1:** Created a button using TypeScript and added a “fun” emoji.\
   The rice bowl serves as the basis for a rice farming and chef simulator.

2. **Step 2:** Implemented a counter to track the total number of rice bowls accumulated per click.

3. **Step 3:** Set up an automatic clicker to add 1 unit per second in addition to player input.

4. **Step 4:** Utilized `requestAnimationFrame()` to calculate frame rates, manage continuous growth, and update the counter in real time.

5. **Step 5:** Initialized counter growth to zero until upgrades are purchased.\
   Added upgrade buttons to exchange rice bowls for increased RPS (rice per second).

6. **Step 6:** Defined upgrade constants, buttons, and systems.\
   Displayed the corresponding number of times upgrades were purchased.

7. **Step 7:** Introduced exponential cost scaling for upgrades after each purchase.

8. **Step 8:** Designed UI components for rice empire.

9. **Step 9:** Implemented **data-driven design** by using loops to process data from the `availableItems` array, removing all hardcoded references.

10. **Step 10:** Expanded game content to include **markets, temples, dragons, and warriors**.\
    Updated UI containers, counters, and production tracking systems. Reorganized `main.ts` functions and main loops structure for more readability.
